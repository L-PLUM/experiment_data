An Owned contract, to be inherited by other contracts.

Provides an onlyOwner access modifier.

To change owner, the current owner must nominate the next owner,
who then has to accept the nomination. The nomination can be
cancelled before it is accepted by the new owner by having the
previous owner change the nomination (setting it to 0).

Depot contract. The Depot provides
a way for users to acquire synths (Synth.sol) and SNX
(Synthetix.sol) by paying ETH and a way for users to acquire SNX
(Synthetix.sol) by paying synths. Users can also deposit their synths
and allow other users to purchase them with ETH. The ETH is sent
to the user who offered their synths for sale.

This smart contract contains a balance of each token, and
allows the owner of the contract (the Synthetix Foundation) to
manage the available balance of synthetix at their discretion, while
users are allowed to deposit and withdraw their own synth deposits
if they have not yet been taken up by another user.
