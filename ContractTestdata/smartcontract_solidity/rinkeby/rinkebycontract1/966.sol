 * THE TRIIP PLEDGE
 * A deep love of the environment and a recognition of the need to take strong, immediate action to protect is at the heart of everything we do. By partnering with us, you’re joining us in our mission to meaningful solutions to the the growing ecological crisis.It means a lot to us, so we’re offering all who sign the Triip Pledge an amount of token. You’re already doing a lot by reading this white paper, so please accept this gift as our show of thanks.
 * On top of that, we’re contributing 1% of each booking conducted on Triip to a Sustainable Fund that we’re using to advance a series of sustainability projects, including plastic waste reduction program SaveYourOcean.com. We’re a blockchain and travel company, but we’re also much more than that. Similarly, you’re more than just a traveler and a consumer. You’re an important part of the change we all need to make together to chart a different course for the Earth and all those who share our home.
